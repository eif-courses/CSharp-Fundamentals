/*
 * The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
 * states that "you should be able to use any derived class
 * instead of a parent class and have it behave in the same manner without modification". 
 * It ensures that a derived class does not affect the behavior of the parent class, in other words,
 * that a derived class must be substitutable for its base class.
 * This principle is just an extension of the Open Closed Principle 
 * and it means that we must ensure that new derived classes extend the base classes without changing their behavior.
